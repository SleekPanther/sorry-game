# Sorry

This was a group project for a software engineering class with the goal of replicating the board game [Sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)). But we weren't able to complete everything we wanted on time. There are some parts of the rules that we didn't enforce but overall the game is playable and shouldn't have many major bugs.

Omitted due to time constraints:
- Cards with choices, 7 card splitting moves, or the 10 card (forward 10 back 1), 11 card, sorry card for computers
- Saving/resuming games
- Animations for computer moves would not work (hence the presence of "Previous move" since all move at once)
- Sometimes Yellow as a Human player can't move onto the last square before home (don't know why so don't choose yellow)
