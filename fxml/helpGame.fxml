				The object of the game is to get all of your pawns to your\n
				home base before all the other players. You start out in the\n
				START space and cannot leave until you draw a 1 or 2 card.\n
				When you have a pawn to move, follow the rules on the card \n
				to move it around the board, such as move 8 spaces forward,\n
				or move 4 spaces backward. Pawns can also slide if you land\n
				on the start of a slide. If you land in a space occupied by\n
				another pawn, or hit them during your slide, you bump them \n
				back to the start. Entering the home base is a safety zone\n
				where you are free from bumps by other players.

				to move another pawn, click that one instead of clicking \n
				the confirmation square.
